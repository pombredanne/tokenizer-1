CSC254 HWK02 : Tokenizer

This folder contains 3 files:
1. input_file.c  : c program for tokenization
2. tokenizer.py : python2.7 script to tokenize the input_file and return a new output_file
3. README : this file

How to run this program:
    In terminal:     python tokenizer.py input_file.c

Program Description:
   This program contain two classes. One is Token and the other is Scanner.
   Each token in Token class has two attributes, name(token type) and value.
   Scanner has next_token() function, which is the main part of this program.
   Check specific comments in the codes.

   Scanner will read a C input file char by char, and detect the valid tokens,
   such as reversed words, identifiers, numbers, meta_statements, and string. 
   And then it also adds '_cs254' after each identifers, and write the new program 
   in the output_file.c
   Also, this program will print the tokens(name and value) in the console.
   In addition, it also announces 'ERROR!!!' when detect illegal tokens, 
   like '2010i', '!', and '/*--' without '*/'.
